## üîß Alternative Notification Channels

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization

### Modify Email Content

- `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` - Build notifications

### Change Email Provider
Replace Gmail SMTP settings with your provider:
```yaml
server_address: smtp.your-provider.com
server_port: 587  # or your provider's port
```

### Add More Notification Types
You can add notifications for:
- New releases
- Security alerts  
- Deployment success/failure
- Code review requests

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Not Receiving Emails?
1. **Check spam folder** - GitHub emails sometimes land there
2. **Verify secrets** - Make sure all three secrets are set correctly
3. **Check app password** - Ensure it's the 16-character app password, not your regular password
4. **Gmail settings** - Ensure "Less secure app access" is not blocking it

### Build Notifications Not Working?
1. **Check workflow syntax** - YAML indentation must be perfect
2. **Verify secret names** - They are case-sensitive
3. **Check Actions logs** - Go to repository Actions tab to see error details

### Email Content Issues?
1. **HTML formatting** - Test your HTML in an email client
2. **GitHub variables** - Ensure `${{ github.* }}` variables are available in that context
3. **Character encoding** - Use UTF-8 for special characters

## üìã Security Best Practices

‚úÖ **Use app passwords**, never your main Gmail password  
‚úÖ **Limit repository access** to secrets  
‚úÖ **Regularly rotate** app passwords  
‚úÖ **Use separate email** for notifications if desired  
‚úÖ **Monitor secret usage** in GitHub's audit logs

## üéØ Next Steps

Once email notifications are working:
1. **Customize templates** to match your preferences
2. **Add team members** to notification emails
3. **Set up Slack/Discord** if your team uses them
4. **Configure mobile notifications** for critical alerts
